CSS Advanced Project

This project is part of the ALX HTML & CSS curriculum, focusing specifically on advanced CSS styling. The goal is to bring a static HTML layout to life using clean, responsive, and pixel-perfect CSS based on a Figma design file.

Project Overview

We were provided with:

- A base HTML file to work from.
- A Figma file as a design reference.
- A zip file containing the required assets (images, logos, icons, etc.).

The challenge was to translate the Figma design into a fully styled web page using CSS while maintaining responsive behavior and design accuracy.
